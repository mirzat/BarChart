Simple-Calendar
========

A Simple Calendar to store notes:

It displays a full calendar for each day of the current month in a table;

- each cell displays the date in the ‘01/01/69’ format, and an input box underneath;

- each input box contains the text ‘please enter a note’, that disappears when the user clicks the box;

- at the bottom of the page, there is a ‘Save and Display’ button;

- when the button gets clicked the page saves the information to a database and displays the same calendar 
  with the saved note for each day underneath the date in the cells.
